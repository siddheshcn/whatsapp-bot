# Seven Scenarios You Need to Prepare For

> **"Excuse me, passengers, the captain is requesting a doctor to assist with an emergency. Please press the call light so the attendant can find you."**  

**Ding; Ding; Ding**  

The quiet dark cabin allowed me to hear the chorus of call light volunteers.  

**Situation controlled,** I thought, pulling the blanket over my head.  

Little did I know that my **loving and proactive wife** had pushed my call light and even **flagged down the attendant.**  

> **"He can help."**  

I felt her arm pointing over me.  

I had spent a few years practicing in the real world, saving up some money along the way. **It was my first time in first class,** a gift for our **wedding anniversary.** We were headed to a **safari in South Africa.** I had donned every first-class amenity offered. **Why not?**  

The attendant pulled back the curtain and motioned for me to follow down the aisle. It took a moment for my **dilated pupils to adjust** from the darkness of my seat. As I emerged, **searing sunlight** greeted me, and my **fellow travelers fixed their eyes on me,** noticing the **eye mask draped around the neck of my airline pajamas.** I froze in the awkward moment.  

The flight attendant **tugged at my sleeve,** and we swiftly moved to the passenger. The attendant handed me a container that **resembled a fishing tackle box:** needles, syringes, and a **boatload of medications** I hadn't seen in years. There was a **nice little instruction manual written in a foreign language.**  

I swallowed hard, sifted through the **cobwebs in my brain,** and heard the EMT within echo:  
> **"When was the last time you started an IV, brother? ABC, ABC, ABC."**  

The passenger made it through the flight. The flight attendant crew rewarded me with a **self-selected complimentary bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue.** It was polished off before we made it to our destination.  

Every plane comes with instructions on how to **buckle your seatbelt**, plus a **laminated placard on how to inflate a raft** for an emergency water landing. There's even an **indecipherable little manual** for the **emergency tackle box.**  

But an **essential guide** on **how to handle tricky scenarios** for **lifesaving doctors in the real world?** We have **none.**  

Until now.  

Here are **seven common scenarios** you will **likely face** in your practice. I still face some of these situations after my **many years in practice.** And to be honest, I don't always **excel in them** the first time, despite **considering myself an experienced and self-aware physician.**  

As you read each scenario, take some time to think about your personality. **What will be your most likely natural tendency** in that circumstance? **What, if anything, should you do instead?**  

Knowing what you **should do in advance** doesn't mean you will automatically **execute as hoped,** but it sure will **keep you one step ahead of trouble.**

## **Scenario 1: The Offending Question**

It was **Labor Day weekend,** and I was called to the **emergency room** to evaluate an **eighteen-year-old college student** who had suffered a **severe open skull fracture** in a **Jet Ski accident.** By the time I saw him, it was clear he **needed immediate brain surgery.**  

People feel comforted when their **surgeon walks into the room** and is **weathered, with gray hair,** and at least **appears** as if he has been doing this **longer than they have been alive.** **That wasn't me.**  

I was near the **beginning of my career.** While new practicing physicians **often look young,** for some reason I appeared **even younger than most.** I was in my **early thirties,** but my **gangly build** and **boyish face** made me **look more like a teenager.**  

The family **politely listened** as I explained the **concerning issue with the brain,** the **risks of the surgery,** and that we **had to operate immediately.**  

Then the **mother asked me** in a **hesitating voice:**  
> **"You have... you have done this before?"**  

I was **offended.** She had **no right to question** my **skill set** after my **near-decade of training.** I had **earned the right** to be there and was trained to have **excellent knowledge and surgical skills.** I **resented the implication.**  

---

> **Remember the Golden Rule: treat others as you would like others to treat you.**  

---

There were **two ways** I could handle this question.  

### **Door One:**  
My **unchecked amygdala response** could have thrown down a **searing retort:**  
> **"Listen, I've got this handled. I wouldn't be here if I didn't know what I was doing."**  

But at this point in my career, I knew **success in moving her son forward to surgery** was **not behind that door.**  

She would **shut down,** possibly **call for another opinion,** or **slow down the decision** in some other way. **She would seek to alleviate the real and understandable anxiety we all feltâ€”and her son did not have that kind of time.**  

His **life was actually on the line.**  

### **Door Two:**  
So instead, at some cost to my **ego,** I chose **Door Two: Let the offense go.**  

I acknowledged the **mother's feelings** the **best way I knew how** at that time.  

I said:  
> **"Ma'am, I understand this is a tough situation for everyone. And yes, this is a high-risk procedure. But this is the world I live in. This is what I've been trained to do."**  

I **finished our dialogue calmly,** answering all her questions. I **assured her** that our team was **comfortable with the operation** and that we would do **everything we could** to make sure her **son did well.**  

The **mother calmed down,** and I could see she would **at least accept the idea of trusting me.**  

Looking back, I now **understand** that her **question was not a judgment** of my competence. It **simply reflected her emotional angst** in a difficult situation and her **fear of the unknown.**  

Her **son's life was hanging in the balance,** and the man who was about to operate on him **barely appeared to be a man,** let alone a **seasoned surgeon.**  

The **right answer,** as hard as it can be, is **not to take these feelings personally.** Instead, **address the underlying emotional issue at play.**  

---

### **What I learned from this experience** was the **importance of connecting before consulting.**  

I **connected with the mother** by **prioritizing her emotions** and **acknowledging the difficult situation** she was in **before discussing the medical details.**  

**When people feel heard, they are more likely to take in what you need to convey.**  

> **Connect before consulting: address the emotion in the room.**  

---

## **Scenario 2: Dr. Google**

Many patients will have **done their research** before they come to visit you for their clinic appointment. Their resources will be a **plethora of incomplete information,** typically **bits and pieces** from **family and friends** or even **local organizations,** such as **work or church.**  

My favorite is **"Dr. Google."** I have found that **more than offering solutions,** Dr. Google **leaves patients asking more questions.** Truthfully, I, too, have **investigated Dr. Google** for the conditions I treat. And the **information available in layman's terms** is **confusing even for me.** A few clicks and the word **"cancer" inevitably appears.**  

Patients have come to my clinic **certain** that their diagnosis is **cancer** or maybe some **rare pig parasite from Brazil,** when in fact it is **something else.**  

I have learned to become **more understanding and adaptable** with my **responses** in these common scenarios. Some of the **information makes sense to me,** and some... well... **has left me questioning their resources.**  

Early in my career, I **reacted to off-the-beaten-path information** with a **slightly dismissive undertone.** In one situation, I **interrupted a patient** who presented me with a **folder of research documents.** I **flipped through the pages** in the folder and **curtly responded:**  

> **"No, that's a bunch of BS. They don't know what they're talking about."**  

The **patient's response** was **almost entirely nonverbal.** I could see that they **felt deflated.** **I sounded full of myself.**  

My **impatience prevented me** from delivering **excellent patient care** on that day, and **I regretted being dismissive.**  

My **response now** is **more supportive, or at least neutral.** Common responses I use today include:  

- **"Wow. That's interesting."**  
- **"I like that."**  
- **"Great job on doing the homework."**  

For these patients, I have found **success in commending their efforts** instead of **criticizing their information.**  

**Acknowledging patients** for **taking ownership of their medical condition** is a great way to **connect before explaining the reality** of the situation.  

Which **rarely involves** a **pig parasite from Brazil.**  

---

## **Scenario 3: "But the Other Doctor Said..."**

Like **Mrs. Dionne,** a **sixty-four-year-old active woman** with **back and leg pain,** patients may seek you for a **second opinion.**  

Mrs. Dionne was a **surgical candidate** who came to me to **verify** that she indeed **needed surgery.**  

During my evaluation, she **interrupted, saying:**  

> **"But the other surgeon said... Why did they say this?"**  

I remember, first, **not enjoying being interrupted** and, second, **feeling uninterested** in **comparing my thoughts** with another surgeon.  

In my early years, my **earnest desire** to **stretch the extra mile** to help the patient **understand "the other opinion"** led to **assumptions** that were **unfortunately incomplete.**  

I have learned to instead **focus directly** on the **scenario in front of me.** Instead of **meandering down the unknown road** of another physician's opinion, I now respond with:  

> **"Thank you for sharing that with me. But I can't speak to the other physician's thoughts. Based on my evaluation of you, I recommend..."**  

This **approach kindly notifies the patient** that I am **not willing to cross the line of professionalism.**  

Speculating on another physician's opinion **without understanding the full context** of the **physician-patient conversation** breaches an **unspoken code of conduct** of our profession.  

There are **subtle nuances** with each **patient interaction** that **direct a physician's opinion.**  

I wouldn't want **another physician opining** on **my diagnosis and treatment plan** **without having a full understanding** of what I **observed and evaluated.**  

---

> **Remember the Golden Rule: treat others as you would like others to treat you.**  

---

## **Scenario 4: "I'm Worse Off"**

It's **inevitable.** Sometimes your **tireless efforts** will have **unexpected outcomes.**  

People who **should get better** just **do not.** They tell you they are **"worse off."**  

That's **reality.**  

There have been **moments when I felt defeated** after doing **everything I could** for my patient. It could have been a combination of:  

- **The disease process itself**  
- **Their physically deconditioned status**  
- **Their psychological state** that prevented the desired outcome  

I have been **surprised** to learn that sometimes a **secondary influence prevents a good outcome.**  

**Experience has taught me** that there are **obvious and not-so-obvious influences** that can affect patient results.  

I take **time and effort** to ensure that **each patient** has the **best outcome possible.** My **professional identity** is **tied to that outcome,** so I will **sacrifice whatever it takes** to get it right.  

**Patients trust me,** and I take that **trust seriously.**  

That doesn't mean I don't also **strive to understand moments of personal failure** after **operating on a patient.**  

---

### **Mr. Smith's Story**  

**Mr. Smith** came to the clinic and **complained** of:  

- **Low back pain**  
- **Bilateral leg pain**  

He had **failed nonoperative treatment** for **months** and was **quite miserable.**  

The **MRI of his lumbar spine** demonstrated **severe stenosis.**  

I diagnosed **Mr. Smith** with **lumbar stenosis** causing **neurogenic claudication** and recommended **lumbar surgery.**  

The **surgery was accomplished as planned,** and I was **satisfied** with the results.  

I spoke with the family afterward and **assured them** that I **expected him to feel better.**  

For the **two-week follow-up appointment,** I was **eager** to see **Mr. Smith and his family.**  

I walked into the room **in an upbeat fashion** and asked:  

> **"Well, how are things?"**  

**Mr. Smith responded** in an **accusatory and disappointed tone:**  

> **"I am worse off than before surgery. I am just beside myself that I had the surgery."**  

I was **not expecting that response,** and truthfully, his comment was **hurtful.**  

I'm **not in the business of making patients worse.**  

Did they not understand the **intense emotional energy** it took for me to try to **help him?**  

His **surgery was no walk in the park.** **I worked hard to take care of him.**  

---

### **A Moment of Choice**  

**Internally, I was irritated.**  

I **wanted to look him in the eye** and respond:  

> **"You are ungrateful."**  

And then **tersely give him reasons** why he **should be grateful.**  

Instead of **feeling proud** of how I took care of him, I **felt as if I had done something malicious.**  

At **that moment,** I had a **choice.**  

I could **respond at the same level of his anger**â€”and believe me, **I wanted to.**  

However, **I was the authority in the room,** and if I **belittled him in return,** I would do so from a **perceived position of power.**  

**Nothing good would have come from that.**  

Perhaps I could have been **dismissive** and told him that the outcome was **his problem** and **blamed his body.**  

*(Sound familiar?)*  

That **would've been a great countermove.**  

I'd **feel better,** but **he'd leave feeling much worse.**  

A **no-win situation** there as well.  

---

### **The Better Response**  

Instead, **I chose to validate his feelings** and then **express my own.**  

**Validating someone** is saying, **explicitly or implicitly,** that their **feelings and experience are heard.**  

It is **possible to validate someone's feelings** and still **disagree** with their **conclusions or actions.**  

In this case, I said:  

> **"I understand you are frustrated. I am just as disappointed as you are."**  

I **took him through everything I had accomplished,** driven by a **sincere desire to help.**  

The **walk-through** helped him **better understand** but did **not satisfy his expectations.**  

At least it was **progress** and, more importantly, **I avoided making a bad situation worse.**  

---

Ultimately, **Mr. Smith improved** and the **whole exchange was water under the bridge.**  

Sometimes you just need to **buy time** without **further complicating** the issue at hand.  

---

### **Key Takeaway**  

> **Self-awareness gives you the ability to mitigate your mistakes.**  

---

## **Scenario 5: It's the Right Thing to Do**

I was a **fourth-year medical school student** rotating in the **honors surgery program** at the **University of Louisville.**  

The **second-year surgery resident** manning the **ICU all night** looked **weary.** He had been **putting out a lot of patient fires.**  

At **6 a.m.,** the whole **general surgery division** gathered at the door of the **first ICU patient.**  

Today we were having the **famous "Polk Rounds,"** led by the **notable chairman of surgery, Dr. Hiram Polk.**  

The **resident stood at attention** with **confidence** and began his **presentation** of **ICU Patient No. 1.**  

A **dialogue ensued** between the **resident and the pharmacist** about **whether the patient should be on antibiotics.**  

Ultimately, the **resident ended the conversation** with:  

> **"It's the right thing to do."**  

I remember the **dismayed look** on the **pharmacist's face.**  

By saying **"It's the right thing to do,"** the resident had **unintentionally implied** that the pharmacist **did not want to do the right thing.**  

---

### **Key Takeaway**  

Be **mindful** of this phrase.  

If you **do feel** your **idea or action** is in the **best interest of the patient,** instead say:  

- **"In my experience, I have seen..."**  
- **"This is what has worked for me in the past."**  

By **stating your idea from an unquestionable experience,** you will be **effectively delivering your message** without **stepping on anyone else's toes.**  

---

## **Scenario 6: Shooting the Messenger**  

It was **6:56 a.m.,** just **four minutes** from the **end of my on-call shift,** and my **phone buzzed again.**  

I was **exhausted, irritable, hungry.**  

I had **operated all night** and was **counting the minutes** until the **end of my call shift.**  

But the **dawn brought on a new day,** and a **normal full day's work** lay ahead of me.  

---

### **The Call**  

> **"Dr. Patel, I have a consult for you,"** the **tired resident** on the **other end of the line** politely stated.  

I **snapped back:**  

> **"What time did the patient come in?"**  
> **"How long have they been here?"**  
> **"Why are you calling me now?"**  
> **"This is a bad consult."**  

I found myself **unloading a barrage of verbal bullets** at this **young resident physician** with all my **frustrations from a tough night.**  

The **resident took a moment** to **collect herself** and thenâ€”**despite an emotionally difficult situation**â€”responded with **poise.**  

> **"Dr. Patel, thank you for taking the call. What is the best way to let you know about a consult in the future?"**  

Boom.  

I was **embarrassed** and **felt put in my place.**  

I had **acted like a child,** and she had **responded like an adult.**  

I **apologized to her,** and we **did the consult.**  

---

### **A Lesson in Emotional Awareness**  

There will be **times in your career** when:  

- The **demands exceed what you believe you can offer.**  
- You will be **tired.**  
- You will be **beaten up.**  
- **Someone will need you** at what seems to be the **worst time.**  

It's in **these moments** that you may sense a **profound isolation,** as if your **struggles go unnoticed and unacknowledged.**  

In that **whirlwind of emotions,** you may feel **consumed with anger and irritation.**  

> **How you choose to respond in that moment matters.**  

The **resident turned a negative situation into a learning experience.**  

Retaliating **would have been far less productive** than **professionally and gently** making me **aware of my shortcomings,** as she did.  

---

### **A Second Chance**  

A **week later,** the **same resident** happened to call againâ€”**just minutes** before my **call shift was over.**  

- **Fatigue, irritability, and dwindling patience** dominated my persona.  
- This time, however, **I managed the situation differently.**  

I recalled a **new acronym** I had recently learned:  

### **HALT**  
A reminder to check for:  
1. **Hunger**  
2. **Anger**  
3. **Loneliness**  
4. **Tiredness**  

These are the **four pillars of emotional vulnerability.**  

It was a **mental cue** that **prompted communication** between my **frontal lobes and amygdala,** helping me **avert any potential self-destructive reactions.**  

This time, **I modified my response:**  

- I **took the information calmly.**  
- I **thanked her warmly.**  

---

### **Key Takeaway**  

The **need for self-awareness remains constant.**  

The **best you can do** is **become comfortable with this reality.**  

> **We all make mistakes.**  

**Self-awareness gives you the ability to mitigate your mistakes**â€”  

In this scenario, it was **to not beat up the same resident twice.**  

---

## **Scenario 7: The Quality Review**

Sooner or later, **every physician providing patient care in a hospital** will encounter a case **subject to quality review.**  

My cases have been **reviewed by a quality committee,** and now **I participate** in reviewing cases **as a member of the quality committee.**  

---

### **A Complex Case Under Review**  

A **seventeen-year-old male** presented to the **emergency room** with **quadriplegia**â€”he was **unable to move his arms and legs.**  

- He had been **pulled out of a shallow pool** by friends after **diving in headfirst** and **breaking his neck.**  
- We **rushed him to the operating room** and **operated all night,** trying **tirelessly** to **save his spinal cord function.**  
- Unfortunately, he remained **unable to move his arms and legs.**  

It was a **complex case, destined for a poor outcome** despite our **heroic efforts.**  

---

### **The Emotional Response to Quality Review**  

When I received **notification** that the case was under **a quality review,** I couldn't help but feel:  

- **Irritated**  
- **Judged** by my peers  
- **Embarrassed**  
- **Defensive**  

The **review process felt personal.**  

The **physicians reviewing the case** were **my peers,** and I **resented feeling judged by them.**  

---

### **The Truth About Quality Reviews**  

What I have **learned time and time again** is that a **quality review** is **not just about the facts.**  

Yes, the **facts are important** and are **scrutinized** long before you enter the room.  

But hereâ€™s the **secret:**  

> **The peer review is more about how you respond to the questions.**  

Your **peers will formulate an impression**â€”and therefore an **assessment**â€”**by how you handle yourself.**  

---

### **A Lesson in Process Improvement**  

After the **review was over,** I learned that:  

- The **case was about what could have been done better**â€”a **process improvement.**  
- **Great organizations** are **constantly looking for ways to improve.**  
- **No one was blaming me or the team** for the poor outcome.  
- The **hospital wanted to know** if there were ways to **handle such cases better in the future.**  

---

### **An Unexpected Invitation**  

My **ultimate takeaway** happened when **Dr. Simon,** the chairman of the **peer review committee,** found me **sitting at the physicians' lounge** table, sipping on my coffee **between surgical cases.**  

He pulled out a chair, sat down, and leaned over.  

> **"Hey, Nimesh, we'd like for you to serve on the quality committee with us."**  

He continued:  

> **"I'm not gonna lie, it's a time commitment. But you're the kind of physician we need: conscientious and professional."**  

---

### **Key Takeaways About Peer Reviews**  

After **ten years** and a **plethora of quality review cases,** I can tell you this:  

- **Physicians often take reviews personally** because we **perceive our work as a reflection of ourselves.**  
- That is the **inherent nature of any accomplished individual.**  
- The **key** is to **understand how you tend to behave** and to **move past it.**  

> **Peer reviews are inevitable.**  

Although they can **feel punitive,** they are instead **proactive measures** to **improve healthcare quality.**  

**Our conduct** in response to these reviews **shapes how we are perceived and treated in return.**  

---

### **Final Thought**  

> **Remember this little secret: A quality review is more about how you respond and behave than the actual facts of the case.**  

---

### **A Challenge to Physicians**  

I **challenge you** to embark on **focused self-exploration**â€”specifically for **physicians.**  

The **next chapter** will require:  

- **Candid introspection** of your **personal ambition**  
- A deep look into your **professional identity**  

As you **read it,** I encourage you to **embrace the transformative power of self-awareness.**  

This will **open a path** toward:  

âœ… **Authenticity**  
âœ… **Fulfillment in your medical practice**
