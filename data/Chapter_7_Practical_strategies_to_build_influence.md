# Practical Strategies for Building Influence

# **Practical Strategies for Building Influence**

## **A FEW YEARS AGO**

I was traveling to the airport to present at a conference. While briefly stopping by the hospital to check on a postoperative patient, I was called by the operating room. My colleague had a patient on the table and was trying to control the bleeding from a ruptured brain aneurysm: a very high-risk moment. He needed an extra pair of hands. I reflexively ran to the operating room in my nice clean suit and pressed white shirt, feeling worried for my colleague and friend. Together, we saved the patient, just in time.

Once everything stabilized, I felt a nudge against my shoulder:  
> **"Man, thanks so much for helping me out. I was losing it there."**  
My usually ice-cool colleague was visibly shaken.

With a grin behind my surgical mask, my response was reflexive.  
> **"I know you would've done the same for me."**

He had, a couple of years earlier. It was **Dr. Stewart,** the fellow neurosurgeon who had helped me out with the **Hail Mary** I shared in chapter 2 of this book.

## **Cultivate Social Capital**

Until that moment with **Dr. Stewart**, I did not understand the impact of **social capital,** yet I had it and used it without hesitation. **Social capital** is a simple concept. Investing in relationships will build **social currency in the bank,** which can be used when you need a favor. The situation with Dr. Stewart was a **large "ask" on a rush basis.**  

A more routine situation in my world is that a **colleague will check on my patients when I am out of town.** When my colleagues need to travel, I'll return the favor. Over time, **this reciprocity builds more trust than any single favor could.**  

Building **social capital** requires **influence.** Unfortunately, we physicians don't have extra time to invest in relationships. Our time is **so overcommitted** that we **barely have enough time to eat.** Building relationships sounds nice, but given our situation, we need **savvy, time-efficient approaches.**  

Here are **three physician-specific strategies.**

---

## **Strategy 1: Acknowledge Individual Efforts**

Physicians concentrate on the **big win; we are high achievers by nature.** The downside is that we **often do not take time to focus on the everyday small wins.** This was a common oversight for me.  

I have learned over the years that **building a team is about creating momentum**—and **celebrating small wins builds momentum faster than anything else.**  

---

### **Celebrate Small Wins and Anchor the Behavior**  

I recall working with **Dr. Kumar,** a busy and well-respected **gastroenterologist.** He complained that the **endoscopy suite never started on time** and that his **whole day was ruined as a result.** But **Dr. Kumar himself was the problem.**  

Despite his disdain for the **"inefficient" schedule,** Dr. Kumar **rarely arrived early to greet the patient** for the procedure. His own **failure to prepare often resulted in a twenty-minute delay.** He was **oblivious to the domino effect** his **lackadaisical approach** would have on **not only his start time but also that of the anesthesiologist and support staff.**  

The administrator **spoke with Dr. Kumar regarding his tardiness.** After reviewing the **call logs and listening to the complaints,** the doctor agreed to **come in earlier,** so that the **7:00 a.m. procedure had a better chance of actually starting on time.**  

After a week, Dr. Kumar was holding up his end of the bargain. The **endoscopy staff playfully created a small scoreboard:**  
> **"On-time starts: Dr. Kumar 5, Late 0."**  

When I ran into **Dr. Kumar in the hallway, he mentioned the scoreboard.** I could tell **he was amused.** The **small celebration made him feel good** and made it **easier to anchor the behavior.** The team **rarely started late again.**  

I learned that **small celebrations make a big impact.**

### **Tell People How They Make Your Day Better**  

Here's another throwback to my **neurosurgery training days.** **Dr. Lorenzo Munoz never had a pen** when we were doing our rounds in the hospital. Every morning when he came to sign the **operative consent forms,** he spent minutes **looking for a pen.** It was frustrating.  

Then one day, I watched the beginning of a **miracle unfold.** **Dr. Munoz was, as usual, looking for a pen when the receptionist handed him one, and he smiled.**  
> **"Every time you have a pen for me, my day gets better," he told her.**  
Every day until I left that service, the **receptionist had a pen waiting for him.**  

Years later, I can attest that **statement works like a charm.** For instance, the **front desk receptionist always has a list of my patients ready to hand me** when I round on the hospital floors... and don't worry, **I always have a pen waiting too.** 

### **Compliment a Person in Front of Others**  

Everyone appreciates compliments. I was coming off a trauma call one morning, and the trauma team, ICU nurses, and I were all gathered around the reception desk. The attending trauma surgeon, **Dr. Amos**, patiently listened to the flat presentation by the junior surgical resident, **Dr. Derrick**.  

At the end of his presentation, she commented:  
> **"Dr. Derrick is a no-nonsense kind of doctor when it comes to excellent patient care."**  

That compliment in front of a third party was impactful. When Dr. Amos validated Dr. Derrick, complimenting him in front of his peers, she elevated him within the group and also built his social capital. Dr. Amos subconsciously influenced all of us to adopt the complimentary view of Dr. Derrick, regardless of his bland personality.

### **Remember Birthdays**  

I never really celebrated birthdays, but a few years ago, the **neurosurgical ICU changed my opinion** on why it's important to mark that moment. It was my birthday, but the **day was so busy** that I completely forgot.  

I walked into the unit, and the **staff gave me a picture of a birthday cake.** I was touched that they had remembered me.  

The nurses said:  
> **"We know how you like to watch your carbs, so the real cake"** (pointing to the table in the corner) **"is for us. This one's for you."**  

I chuckled and took a big piece of the cake from the table. As I put the fork in my mouth, I said:  
> **"Good thing it's my cheat day today."**  

The **birthday cake picture is pinned** next to **patient letters and cards** I keep on a bulletin board. Every time I look at it, **I'm reminded of how a group of people made me feel special** by just **remembering my birthday.**  

These days, I **conscientiously add the birthdays of colleagues to my calendar.** And on their birthday, I send a **small text.** This gesture is **a new thing for me.** Everyone appreciates a quick **"Happy Birthday"** text or even **a picture of a cake.**  

---

### **Use Food to Connect**  

I once overheard a disgruntled surgeon complaining to the **operating room charge nurse** about the special treatment of other surgeons. The objection was that **Dr. Patel was getting special treatment** for **after-hours staffing.** The charge nurse **firmly responded** that it had **nothing to do with policy,** but rather that **staff volunteered to stay late for Dr. Patel’s cases.**  In the background, one of the nurses jokingly said:  
> **"Yeah, it's always pizza night when we do."**  
Apparently, **a little pizza goes a long way.**  

If the **staff stays late to take care of a patient,** order **pizza for everyone.** If you **make rounds on the weekend,** pick up a **box of doughnuts for the staff.** This technique is **rooted in science.** **Food causes the brain to release dopamine,** and **dopamine release causes us to feel pleasure.** Teams that **feel good about each other have more connection** and **give each other extra leeway and consideration.**  

---

### **Embrace the Power of "We"**  

On the day after my **NG tube debacle** (see chapter 3), the **attending on rounds that morning** asked what had happened with the patient, **Mr. Stevens,** the night before. There were about **seven of us**: the **other surgical residents,** a couple of **medical students and nurses,** and me. The **smell of vomit was etched into my brain,** so I hesitated before answering.  

The **chief resident, Dr. Joshua, smoothly covered for me** in the pause.  
> **"I made a mistake when the NG tube was inserted," he said.**  
> **"We took care of the issue. The NG tube is now in, and the patient is doing well."**  

The attending physician **gave us a nod of approval,** and we moved on to the next issue.  

By taking the **blame that day**—*"I made a mistake"*-and **sharing credit**—*"We took care of the issue"*-**Dr. Joshua gained my loyalty with the power of "we."** He was **with me.** So, **I was going to be with him.**  

Though, of course, **"we" all knew what really happened**—including the **attending physician.**  

---

### **Share Your Medical Cases**  

In my **first year serving in a leadership role,** I started a **group text with senior physicians.** The idea **seems pretty intuitive now,** but back then **it was a novel idea.** The text string **started out with routine announcements.** The announcements then evolved into **a forum—a chat—where physicians could share difficult and unusual cases.**  

At first, I was **reluctant to share cases** because, as a **young leader,** I **didn't want to appear incompetent.** But **I loved it** when others presented their **"What would you do?"** scenarios.  

Unexpectedly, when **others did share their difficult cases,** I found myself **developing a greater affinity for them.** Their **vulnerability and openness** led to **an unspoken camaraderie,** and the group chat **became a psychological safe place.**  The feeling that **we were all in this together** encouraged me to **feel and act the same.**  What I felt and learned was that **empathy connected us** through sharing those cases. And that **led to improved respect among colleagues.**  

---

## **Strategy 2: Teach Others**  

Up to this point in the chapter, I have discussed the **importance of consistent, small individual efforts** and the **counterintuitive utility of vulnerability.** The second strategy for building alliances is **to teach others.**  

**Teaching will build rapport and increase your influence.** For busy physicians, **teaching is a personal sacrifice.** The audience appreciates that **selfless time commitment,** and that in itself will **earn you their respect.** The act of teaching also demonstrates that **you're interested in other people's welfare** and want to **give back,** and that creates **social capital.**  

In addition, through teaching, you **influence a person's ideology and methodology** on the subject matter. You will perhaps even **create like-minded people**—and **like-minded people connect more easily.**  

---

## **Teaching in the Intensive Care Unit**  

Working in the **intensive care unit (ICU)** is **complex** and can be **stressful for a new doctor.** When I first started practicing in **2009,** I met an **intuitively bright nurse** in the **neurological ICU** named **Stacey.**  

Not long afterward, my **colleagues and I were able to convince her** to join our **neurosurgery practice,** and she became the **lead nurse practitioner.**  

Stacey frequently served as the **charge nurse in the unit** and **mentored younger nurses** and, **nonchalantly, new doctors.** The **neurosurgeons in the group respected and trusted her.**  

While writing this section, I asked her:  

> **"What is the best way for doctors to improve their influence with nurses?"**  

She smiled and in her **Texas twang** said:  
> **"Dr. Patel, you have one opportunity to make a first impression. Start with friendly and open questions."**  

Then, with her **gentle smile,** her tone became a little more **direct:**  

> **"Teaching nurses and the other staff members is not a grand rounds 'pimping session' or the Socratic method, where there are rapid-fire questions.**  
> **Nurses, nursing assistants, and respiratory therapists have been taught to revere the white coat."**  

She continued without skipping a beat:  
> **"They are in a vulnerable position in comparison to a doctor. You need to create a safe space.**  
> **And that's done by starting with teaching simple concepts. They will then feel safe and be more willing to participate in difficult concepts."**  

She led me through **various ICU experiences** she had with doctors. Together, we identified **three effective teaching methods** that can assist doctors in **building influence in the ICU:**  

1. **Informal teaching**  
2. **Formal teaching**  
3. **Recovery**  

---

### **Informal Teaching**  

Informal teaching occurs **spontaneously** while you're **diagnosing or performing procedural steps aloud.** You will discuss **the diagnosis** and briefly **outline the bedside procedure.** This methodology is **favored by new and novice nurses** because it **unfolds in real time.** When they **understand the relevance and importance of the procedure,** and their **particular role in it,** they are **able to take care of the patient better.**  

Typically, **informal teaching** involves **one or more observing nurses** or **patient care technicians** during a procedure. **You will do most of the talking.** When posing questions, **address the entire group rather than singling out individuals.**  

---

### **Let's Walk Through a Scenario**  

Stacey described a time when she was a **new nurse** and a **neurosurgeon placed a bedside ventriculostomy** into the brain.  

She recalled that the neurosurgeon told the team **why the procedure was needed** with a simple description:  
> **"OK, everyone, I'm placing a ventriculostomy on Mr. Carl because his CT scan demonstrates he has hydrocephalus."**  

Then the neurosurgeon walked through **how and why it was important** to them:  
> **"I'm moving the head up thirty degrees to decrease pressure in his brain...**  
> **I'm using lidocaine with epinephrine not only to numb the scalp but also to help with any scalp bleeders..."**  

Stacey added:  
> **"To a new nurse, not only was it fascinating to watch, but also it helped me understand why each step was important and where I needed to help in the future."**  

**"What if having an audience makes me nervous?"** I asked.  

Stacey replied:  
> **"If having an audience during a procedure makes you uncomfortable, then I recommend discussing the steps with the nurses before the procedure.**  
> **This will help everyone involved understand your thoughts and next movements."**  

*"Which helps the doctor become less stressed during the procedure,"* I remarked with a smile.  

---

### **Formal Teaching**  

Stacey described this as a **traditional PowerPoint lecture.**  

> **"Nurses appreciate presentations from doctors.**  
> **They are rare and help us connect the dots for what matters to you."**  

She stressed that when discussing **how to perform a neurological exam,** the **most effective method** is to use **a clinical vignette** or a **typical patient scenario.**  

She concluded by emphasizing:  
> **"Remember, simplicity is more effective and inviting."**  

---

### **Recovery**  

As the conversation progressed, Stacey mentioned a time when **a doctor was having trouble performing a lumbar puncture** on an ICU patient. During the procedure, the physician became **frustrated** and **acted like a jerk to everyone in the room.** He immediately **lost the confidence and respect** of the nursing staff due to his **behavior,** not because of his difficulty with the procedure.  

The **details of that story sounded a bit too familiar.**  

Then she told me something unexpected. After the procedure was completed, the **remorseful doctor walked over to the nurses, apologized for his behavior, and asked what he could do better next time.** 
> **"That insight of owning his poorly handled, stressed-out behavior gained him favor and more respect with the staff."**  

She looked at me with a **big smile.**  

By setting an **inviting tone** and **teaching how the method and science fit together,** you **influence people to invest in and join your team.** No wonder my colleagues were so keen on **convincing Stacey to join our neurosurgery practice.** She is an **invaluable asset to our group and patients.**  

---

### **Giving Back to New Physicians**  

I used to **give mentoring advice** by telling young physicians **what to do.**  That was **minimally effective.**  Over the years, I've found the **best way to introduce a new idea** to a **confident but impressionable young surgeon** is through the words:  
> **"I have found that..."**  

For example, I will say:  
> **"Dr. Cho, I have found that if I make a vertical incision instead of a horizontal one, the wound heals better."**  

The **phrasing makes the information a suggestion** in the form of my experience **rather than a hard rule** that may **clash with what Dr. Cho has learned** thus far as a resident. The **unassuming approach** invites young physicians to **consider other ideas** instead of **refusing them by closing their minds.**  

---

### **Teaching as Part of Patient Care**  

Earlier in this book, I mentioned the **Dr. Google phenomenon.** Many patients **will have done their homework** before their **clinic appointment.** They will **arrive at the visit** with either a **preconceived understanding** or **complete confusion** about their issue.  

Our job is to **lead them toward clarity.** The **first step to clarity** is **helping them distinguish between fact, fiction, and the unknown.** Sometimes, we may simply have to communicate that **there is no single right answer.**  

Intellectual humility with patients **builds trust.** A **trusting, well-educated patient** is an **empowered patient**—one who is **more likely to take their medication** and **adhere to their treatment regimen.**  

Patients can also be our **best allies and advocates in the community.** Taking the time to **teach and contextualize** is **well worth the effort.**  

**Build trust. Through trust, we build allies.**

### **Teaching will build rapport and increase your influence.**

### **Teaching Will Build Rapport and Increase Your Influence**  

### **Teaching Benefits You Too**  

I improved my **personal public speaking skills** by **teaching nurses.** This journey **began as informal didactics** with nurses regarding **patients' cases outside their rooms** and eventually **moved to a structured framework** at nurse **lunch-and-learn meetings.**  

From this experience, I learned the **key concept of "knowing your audience."** Sharing information was important, but I found that **it didn't capture their attention.** I needed to **fine-tune my message** by asking myself,  
*"What's in it for them?"* and *"Why should they care about what I am saying?"*  

Once I **understood how to make my message relatable** to the nurses, I **gained the confidence** to **finesse a message** to speak to **people from any walk of life.** But it all started with **teaching.** Teaching became an **efficient way to build alliances** and **develop a new skill set.**  

---

### **Strategy 3: Join a Committee**  

Individual efforts and teaching **build relationships** without a **large time investment.** Sometimes, however, we will have to **invest time.** That brings up the **third strategy** for building influence—**joining a committee.**  

I **strongly encourage** you to join an **internal hospital committee,** **medical community organization committee,** or **local community organization** that **resonates with you.** Yes, these groups do require a **time commitment,** but they offer **numerous benefits** both to you and the **organization you represent.**  

A **committee membership** provides **exposure** to the **layers of an organization.** It offers a **unique opportunity** to shape **policies, procedures,** and the **manner of implementation** for patient care. The **committee members** gain a **deeper understanding** of the **complexity of competing interests** at play. You learn to **navigate solutions** that require the **support of other members** of the organization. And you are **forced to understand** how **decisions impact** not only you **but everyone involved.**  

**Drive the change instead of being driven by it.** 

---

### **Build Your Curriculum Vitae**  

Medical school students and hopefuls **strengthen their curriculum vitae (CV)** through **volunteering and research.** As practicing physicians, our **CV is built by serving on committees.** Committee service **demonstrates sacrifice, leadership potential,** and **cross-disciplinary understanding.** These are the things that allow us to be **promoted to leadership positions** in the real world.  

My **leadership journey** started with the **Operating Room Committee.** It was within this setting I encountered the **tardy Dr. Kumars of the world.** Through this experience, I **gained insight** into the **complexities of operating room staffing issues,** particularly while managing a **physician who voiced constant complaints** (see more on how we dealt with **Dr. Jay and his tantrums in chapter 10**).  

I became **aware of the importance of culture** and what it took to **keep staff morale high** during tough times, which led to much of the advice in this chapter. By **serving on a committee,** I provided **value to the organization** beyond just my **clinical skills.** It **opened doors** to other **diverse roles** that might not have otherwise been available to me. And most of all, **it was fulfilling.**  

---

### **Develop Negotiation Skills**  

The **committee work process** offers physicians a **valuable opportunity for growth** by fostering **respect** for the **other members' expertise.** We are accustomed to **giving unilateral instructions** to patients and nurses. Working with a **team of experts,** we develop **another entire set of skills.**  

The **committee process** compels us to **articulate and negotiate our perspectives** while seeking to **understand those of others.** We have to **find common ground** and the **best way to move forward,** aligning various points of view.  

At one time, I was involved in a **frequently frustrating** hospital operational issue—**patient discharges.** Initially, I **believed** that **discharging a patient** was accomplished by simply **issuing the order** to discharge the patient. My **committee colleagues** were quick to enlighten me that **discharge was a complex effort** navigated by a team:  

- The **physician**  
- The **nurse**  
- The **social worker**  
- The **pharmacy**  
- The **family** who would manage the patient at home  

Each person on the list had their own **needs and challenges.** And each person on the **committee negotiated their important role** to accomplish the **discharge task.**  

I have found that the **true value** of serving on committees is not **limited to problem-solving** and understanding the **needs of specific departments.** The real benefit comes from **establishing relationships** and becoming **accustomed to working with influential members** across **various disciplines,** each of whom brings their **unique perspectives.** 

---

### **Build Relationships**  

A **committee naturally builds relationships** with **peers, administrators,** and other **hospital staff.** They come to **know you as a person** and not just as another **ordinary physician.**  

For example, I think of the **now-retired Dr. Oslow.** A **silver-haired, gentle,** and **kind physician,** he was involved in a case that was **reviewed by the quality committee.** Ironically, Dr. Oslow had **served on that same committee** in years past and had helped **build the infrastructure** that was implemented that day. Many members of the **committee had personal experience** with **Dr. Oslow,** knowing him to be not only a **conscientious clinician** but also a **thoughtful person.**  

Although the case was measured by **strict objective metrics,** frankly, **Dr. Oslow was not.** His **character, history,** and **relationships advocated for him** without him having to **say a single word.** In an **ambiguous situation,** he received the **benefit of the doubt.** Physicians and administrators across the **hospital vouched for him** because they **knew him from committees.**  

This is **social capital in action**—when he needed it most, **Dr. Oslow benefited** from all the **goodwill and respect** he had nurtured over many years.  

---

### **Build Alliances Now**  

When the **rubber hits the road,** I believe people **will go the extra mile** for those who have **shown an interest in them.** Work **alongside people,** acknowledge **their humanity,** **build trust and relationships** with them, and you will **build your support team.** Having **good connections** and **building alliances** with others **exponentially expands your capacity** to handle those circumstances.  

Similar to **Dr. Oslow,** you, too, will have **a moment of great need** in your career, like it or not.  

**Don't wait until it is too late** to build the **alliances you will need.**  

Equipped with these **efficient and actionable strategies,** you will **quickly garner social capital.** It's time to **become granular** and learn **nuanced personal interactions** with your **patients and colleagues.** These interactions are **the key** to elevating how **people perceive you as a professional.**
